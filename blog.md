## About Me

Hello, I am Israel Yarce, a first-gen Mexican college student at Loyola University of Chicago. I just finished my junior year so I'm going to be a senior this fall semester. I am majoring in Software Engineering. I am orginally from Moline, Illinois but I currently reside in Rogers Park, Illinois which is right by the campus. I hope so sharpen my programming skills by the time I graduate so that I can land a job, hopefully before graduation.
